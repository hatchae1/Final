        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> I was in Boy scouts from 7-14. Along the way I have attained many new skills and made a lot of good friends.
            I started out as a tiger scout and at age 14 I became an Eagle Scout. I am no longer in Scouts because I reached the highest rank.
            The reason I stuck with it for so long is because it looks really good on resumes and applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Memorable Expierences</h2>
        <p>I went on a lot of camping trips with my friendsd in Boy scouts. My favorite camping trips were definitly the summer camps. The summer camps
            were a week long. My boyscout troop took  a camping trip to Catlina Island for a week and did a lot of water activities. I think spending a week with friends
            and learning new skills was by far my favorite memory from Boy Scouts. I also really liked the achievemntsd with being in boy scouts. 
            There were a lot of different ranks I attained andd each one was a seperate challenge.
